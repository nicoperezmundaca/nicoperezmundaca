## Hi there, Let's Talk!👋

## Profile

DevOps engineer with over 5 years of experience in designing, testing, and maintaining scalable application infrastructures. In my previous role, I led the transition from a monolithic architecture to a containerized ecosystem orchestrated with Kubernetes. This involved breaking down legacy systems into microservices, containerizing them with Docker, and streamlining deployment through automated pipelines using GitHub Actions for enhanced efficiency and reliability.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a full-stack engineer, developing data-intensive platforms. This background provided me with a deep understanding of both development and operations, allowing me to bridge these domains effectively and contribute to scalable and high-performance solutions.

I am currently focused on driving innovation and operational excellence within DevOps teams, delivering reliable, cutting-edge infrastructure solutions.
